I've completed a comprehensive feasibility analysis for all three notification features you requested!

Quick Answer: YES - All three are feasible! ✅
Here's what I found:

📧 Feature 1 & 2: Email Automation
Feasibility: HIGHLY FEASIBLE ✅

Auto-confirmation emails on submission
Status update emails when admin changes status
Cost: FREE (using Gmail SMTP or SendGrid free tier)
Time: 2-3 hours to implement
💬 Feature 3: WhatsApp/Telegram Integration
Feasibility: FEASIBLE with important caveats ⚠️

Telegram (RECOMMENDED): ✅

100% free, official API, reliable
Post new requests to district group chats automatically
Easy setup, no verification needed
Time: 3-4 hours to implement
WhatsApp Options:

❌ Unofficial methods: Against TOS, high ban risk - NOT RECOMMENDED
⚠️ Official WhatsApp Business API: Expensive, requires verification, complex - NOT SUITABLE for this use case
💡 My Recommendation:


Implement Email notifications + Telegram integration for the best results:

Users get official confirmations via email
Community volunteers get real-time notifications in Telegram district groups
Both are free and reliable
Total implementation time: 6-9 hours
